                Have you been to the Top of the World in Bay Lake Tower?<br/>This one evening I somehow sneaked (I thought it was snuck) into an elevator bound for the top floor of the Bay Lake Tower. I wasn't complaining because that's exactly where I wanted to go, but I wasn't a vacation club member. A lady came in and pressed her magic band to the panel and off we went. I got off and watched the...

            <h2>Mad Tea Party</h2>
            <p>
                Do you like the Teacups?<br/>The Mad Tea Party or the "Teacups", as most people call it, is a ride I seldom ride. Not because I don't like it. On the contrary, I love it. I rarely go to the parks with anyone who wants to ride it, though. I'm either alone or the group I'm with would rather spend their time on something else. I don't blame them. There are a lot more things to do in Magic Kingdom. I did convince some friends of mine to ride with me...

            <h2>Dinos</h2>
            <p>
                What do you do to keep yourself from turning into a Dinosaur?<br/>So I decided today I would post a photo from my ride. Yup, I work here at Dinosaur in Animal Kingdom normally when I'm not running around the parks and resorts taking pictures or at home editing them. I really like it here. I feel like I've joined a new family and everyone is usually very friendly. Like every place there are few people that have lost the magic as to why they work there. I find it very sad. I call them my dinosaurs. It's not that they are old, it's that they...

            <h2>Castle</h2>
            <p>
                How early do you like to go to the parks?<br/>When I go to the parks to take photos, it's usually very early in the morning or late at night. When I go to the parks on my days off, I go when I feel like it. Then there are the times when I was on vacation. I would wake up super early and try to get as much done in one day as possible. I would never claim to say it was the most...
